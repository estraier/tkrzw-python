      - .tkh : File hash database (HashDBM)
      - .tkt : File tree database (TreeDBM)
      - .tks : File skip database (SkipDBM)
      - .tkmt : On-memory hash database (TinyDBM)
      - .tkmb : On-memory tree database (BabyDBM)
      - .tkmc : On-memory cache database (CacheDBM)
      - .tksh : On-memory STL hash database (StdHashDBM)
      - .tkst : On-memory STL tree database (StdTreeDBM)

    The optional parameters can include an option for the concurrency tuning.  By default, database operatins are done under the GIL (Global Interpreter Lock), which means that database operations are not done concurrently even if you use multiple threads.  If the "concurrent" parameter is true, database operations are done outside the GIL, which means that database operations can be done concurrently if you use multiple threads.  However, the downside is that swapping thread data is costly so the actual throughput is often worse in the concurrent mode than in the normal mode.  Therefore, the concurrent mode should be used only if the database is huge and it can cause blocking of threads in multi-thread usage.

    The optional parameters can include options for the file opening operation.
      - truncate (bool): True to truncate the file.
      - no_create (bool): True to omit file creation.
      - no_wait (bool): True to fail if the file is locked by another process.
      - no_lock (bool): True to omit file locking.
      - sync_hard (bool): True to do physical synchronization when closing.

    The optional parameter "dbm" supercedes the decision of the database type by the extension.  The value is the type name: "HashDBM", "TreeDBM", "SkipDBM", "TinyDBM", "BabyDBM", "CacheDBM", "StdHashDBM", "StdTreeDBM".

    For HashDBM, these optional parameters are supported.

      - cache_buckets (bool): True to cache the hash buckets on memory.
      - cipher_key (string): The encryption key for cipher compressors.

      - max_cached_pages (int): The maximum number of cached pages.
      - page_update_mode (string): What to do when each page is updated: "PAGE_UPDATE_NONE" is to do no operation or "PAGE_UPDATE_WRITE" is to write immediately.

      - sort_mem_size (int): The memory size used for sorting to build the database in the at-random mode.
      - insert_in_order (bool): If true, records are assumed to be inserted in ascending order of the key.

    For TinyDBM, these optional parameters are supported.
      - num_buckets (int): The number of buckets for hashing.

    For BabyDBM, these optional parameters are supported.
      - key_comparator (string): The comparator of record keys. The same ones as TreeDBM.

    For CacheDBM, these optional parameters are supported.
      - cap_rec_num (int): The maximum number of records.
      - cap_mem_size (int): The total memory size to use.

    All databases support taking update logs into files.  It is enabled by setting the prefix of update log files.
      - ulog_prefix (str): The prefix of the update log files.
      - ulog_max_file_size (num): The maximum file size of each update log file.  By default, it is 1GiB.

    If the optional parameter "num_shards" is set, the database is sharded into multiple shard files.  Each file has a suffix like "-00003-of-00015".  If the value is 0, the number of shards is set by patterns of the existing files, or 1 if they doesn't exist.

    :param params: Optional keyword parameters.
    :return: The result status.

    The optional parameters can include an option for the concurrency tuning.  By default, database operatins are done under the GIL (Global Interpreter Lock), which means that database operations are not done concurrently even if you use multiple threads.  If the "concurrent" parameter is true, database operations are done outside the GIL, which means that database operations can be done concurrently if you use multiple threads.  However, the downside is that swapping thread data is costly so the actual throughput is often worse in the concurrent mode than in the normal mode.  Therefore, the concurrent mode should be used only if the database is huge and it can cause blocking of threads in multi-thread usage.

    The optional parameters can include options for the file opening operation.
      - truncate (bool): True to truncate the file.
      - no_create (bool): True to omit file creation.
      - no_wait (bool): True to fail if the file is locked by another process.
      - no_lock (bool): True to omit file locking.
      - sync_hard (bool): True to do physical synchronization when closing.

    The optional parameter "file" specifies the internal file implementation class.  The default file class is "MemoryMapAtomicFile".  The other supported classes are "StdFile", "MemoryMapAtomicFile", "PositionalParallelFile", and "PositionalAtomicFile".

    For the file "PositionalParallelFile" and "PositionalAtomicFile", these optional parameters are supported.
      - block_size (int): The block size to which all blocks should be aligned.
      - access_options (str): Values separated by colon.  "direct" for direct I/O.  "sync" for synchrnizing I/O, "padding" for file size alignment by padding, "pagecache" for the mini page cache in the process.
